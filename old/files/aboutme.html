			<p class="blurb">  <img class="profile" src="../images/wushu.jpg" alt="Andrew doing wushu"/> Hey there! My name's Andrew! I am a recent graduate of Cornell University, and my passions 
	revolve around learning and practicing web/software development, building things (anything really), and 
	the not-so-well known sport of Wushu. It's a pretty safe bet that if I ever do have free time that isn't 
	sucked up by YouTube videos and the occasional video/board game, I will most likely be doing something 
	related to one of those three things.<br><br>

	A lot of those passions were discovered during my time on the slope. I had actually never written code, 
	nor heard of Wushu, prior to going to college. However, it really is an amazing time for some firsts. 
	Within my first two years I had picked up web development skills that landed me two of my first three 
	jobs ever. I was mostly looking for a place to practice my skills, happened upon an 
	<a href="http://ihf.cornell.edu">institute</a> that needed some help and was willing to take a risk on 
	a mostly unproven college student, and the rest was history. I worked there until my graduation. I also 
	TA-ed a data-driven web course in my senior year. However, I was still hungry to learn more. Every shiny, 
	new thing I saw on a webpage encouraged me to dig deeper and try to pick up new technologies that would 
	allow me to replicate those same things that caught my eye. I'm definitely still learning more as of today.
	</p>

	<p class="blurb"> <img class="profile2" src="../images/rapid.jpg" alt="Guts of a chalk printer"/>I suppose I should talk about my love for building next. It's really been something that's followed me my 
	entire life. From building a pea shooter out of a copper pipe and a glove finger, to a lacrosse ball 
	catapult built out of a bucket, PVC pipes, a lacrosse stick, and counterweights, the willingness to make 
	something, mostly to prove to myself that I could do it, has followed me for a long time. Building really 
	is a hobby without borders. You can build (compose) music. I've tried my hand at that, and my test listeners 
	will attest that it's not my strongest point, haha. You can build visual effects, something I do devote a lot 
	of time to. I do believe that the ability to capture someone's attention solely through the quality and uniqueness 
	of video and effects is a rare talent worth pursuing and honing. I do enjoy going on the occasional creative 
	binge, just seeing if I can make what I see in my mind a reality. (Note: I am stubborn. It takes a lot for me 
	to admit when I'm beat.)<br><br>

	Lastly, there's my love of Wushu. I suppose it encompasses some of the concepts I spoke about earlier. 
	It's definitely a sport that never stops teaching, so I'll never stop learning. "What made my last move
	so crisp/sloppy?" "How does a slightly longer windup affect my jump height and rotation?" The more of these 
	questions I answer, the more I find I will have to learn to ever be as good as I want to be. Visually, the 
	sport is nothing short of stunning. To see all the individual flairs accenting the years of training by 
	professionals is a feast for the eyes, regardless of your familiarity with what you're watching. Lastly, 
	Wushu does give me the chance to build. My body. My mental endurance. My own form. And friendships that
	I hope will last a lifetime.
